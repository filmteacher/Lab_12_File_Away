public class DataSaver {
}



//In the same IntelliJ project, create a java program called DataSaver.java and add it to GitHub src control.
//The program collects data from the user and saves it to a text file.
//Use the SafeInput library for getting the data.
//Write the data in the CSV record format.
//
//Data:
//•	First Name
//•	Last Name
//•	ID Number (a zero replaced string of 6 digits 000001, 000002, etc.)
//•	Email
//•	Year of Birth (a four digit integer 1978, etc.)
//
//Here is a sample CSV record:
//Bilbo, Baggins, 000001, BBaggins@shire.net, 1044
//Loop the data input routine to allow the user to create as many records as they wish.
//Save the CSV records initially into an arrayList of type <String> and then once the user has completed the input of all the records prompt for the file name (add the .csv extension) and write the data into the csv file which should be in the src. Directory of the intelliJ project.
//Run your program and create a data file record that has at least 3 CSV records.
//
//Screenshots
//Paste a screenshot here that shows the Data Input.
//Paste a screenshot here that shows the saved file in the src directory of IntelliJ.
//Paste a screenshot here that shows the file opened in the IntelliJ editor.
//
//Criteria:
//Program uses safe input to loop and collect record data
//which is saved as csv into an arrayList and then written to a text file on disk.
//Screenshots of the input the file on the disk and the open file in the editor.
